# graphs
try to make opentsdb graphs a little bit better

# Notes

Goland with a help of python to show how easy would have been to create highchart (JS) graphs from OpentTSDB.

The only reason this exists because people really believe a graph only if the lines and color palette are beatiful to the eyes.

If I was to redo that I wouldn't. But if I really was I would use D3.
